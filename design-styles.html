            <p>
    Modern interior design is a style characterized by simplicity, functionality, and an emphasis on clean lines and open spaces.
    This approach to design emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One of the key principles of modern interior design
    is minimalism, which involves using only essential elements to create a streamlined and clutter-free environment.

            <p>
    Minimalist style of interior design is rooted in the principle of “less is more.” This style focuses on creating spaces that are
    both serene and efficient. Natural light plays a crucial role in minimalist interiors. Large windows and strategically placed mirrors
    amplify the light, creating a bright and airy atmosphere. Minimalist style fosters a harmonious environment by merging aesthetic
    simplicity with practical design, making it a timeless choice for modern living.
